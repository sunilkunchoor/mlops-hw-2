"""Prometheus metric definitions.

All metrics live on the default registry, defined at module-import time.
Importing this module is idempotent; instantiation happens once.

Three signal classes (see STUDENT_README.md):
- Cheap signals: emitted from /chat on every request.
- State signals (gauges): point-in-time view of the service.
- Sampled signals: emitted by the async judge worker.

NOTE FOR STUDENTS (Task 4): several metric definitions have been removed —
you'll find them as `# TODO (Task 4)` comments below. Define each Counter
or Histogram following the existing `chat_requests_total` example, then
wire them up at the right call sites in src/assistant/service.py and
src/monitoring/judge_worker.py (also marked with TODO comments there).
